Password-Generator:

Generate password() - defines variables, obtains criteria for valid password, generates password

Write password() - displays generated password in text area

As a developer with access to sensitive data,
I want to randomly generate a password that meets certain criteria,
So that I can create a strong password that provides greater security.
